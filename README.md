# Randomized-Ship-Selector

Have you ever had no idea what ship to play?  
Do you want RNG before the match even starts?  
Did you want to pick a random ship by closing your eyes and clicking somewhere in the port but then you select something you dont want to play?  
Do you want an easy tool to select a random ship for you?  
Look no further!  
Randomized Ship Selector lets you customize the list from which you want to pick ships and randomly selects one!  

**How to open/install:**  
No installation required! 
- Download the .zip file here: [RandomizedShipSelector.zip](https://github.com/DInbound/Randomized-Ship-Selector/releases/latest)  
- Unpack it (unzip) and run the executable file (.exe).  

Take note that there is a seperate .dll file in the zip file.  
That .dll needs to accompany the executable at all times otherwise the application will not work!

**But D_Inbound, it is an executable? How do I know if i can trust it or not?**  
Like all other things off the internet, you dont. But if you download this mod off the official World of Warships forums or Github, you can be 99% sure that nobody but me has uploaded it and that it is legit software!
If you dont trust me you can check the contents of the application for yourself on Github.

Here you can read the source code, track the development and clone the project so you can build it yourself.
Note: I made this program in VS 2017 and it might not be compatible with earlier versions of VS.

**How does it work I hear you asking?**  
Well I painstakingly made a list of all ships with their attributes to filter them on (nation, tier, premium) and then let RNG decide which ship YOU need to play.
Lets have a look at the very basic UI first:
The top half contains filters. There are 4 criteria on which to filter ships: Tier, Nation, Class and Premium status.
Select your prefered filters and click the Randomize button, the application will then present a ship based on your filters.
The application will also show how many ships it can choose from.
If the selected ship doesnt change, be sure to check if "Amount of ships to choose from"  isn't 0!

**What are those icons?**  
The ship contour icons I use here are provided (with approval) by Panzerschiffer from his mod: [Historical Ensigns Contour Icons](https://forum.worldofwarships.com/topic/68159-0702-historical-ensigns-contour-icons/).
